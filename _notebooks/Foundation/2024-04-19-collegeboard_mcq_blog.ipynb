    "**Score:** 57/70\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Did Well\n",
    "\n",
    "I performed strongly on most units that involved understanding and interpreting program functionality. For example, I scored:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **100%** on topics like:\n",
    "  - Random Values (3.15)  \n",
    "  - Developing Algorithms (3.9)  \n",
    "  - The Internet (4.1)  \n",
    "  - Safe Computing (5.6)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **91%** on Iteration (3.8), showing comfort with loops and repeating patterns in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **100%** on:\n",
    "  - Conditionals (3.6)  \n",
    "  - Nested Conditionals (3.7), indicating a strong grasp of logical decision-making in Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Struggled With\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Search (3.11):** Scored **0%** — I need to revisit how binary search works conceptually and in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Boolean Expressions (3.5):** Scored **50%**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Abstraction (3.2):** Score was **N/A**, but this topic also needs attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I struggled with evaluating or comparing algorithms based on **efficiency or output**, especially in problems with:\n",
    "  - Dense visuals  \n",
    "  - Multi-step logic\n",

    "## How I Plan to Improve\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Prioritize Creative Development (CRD)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dedicate a significant portion of study time to the **Creative Development** Big Idea.\n",
    "- Focus areas:\n",
    "  - Iterative design process  \n",
    "  - Collaboration strategies  \n",
    "  - Ethical considerations  \n",
    "  - Responsible use of technology\n",
    "- Review examples and practice questions specifically related to CRD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Target Weak Areas within Algorithms and Programming (AAP)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Search:** Deepen understanding of the concept and practice coding it.\n",
    "- **Boolean Expressions:** Review truth tables, logic comparisons, and common traps.\n",
    "- **Data Abstraction:** Explore how data structures simplify code and improve reusability.\n",
    "- **Algorithm Analysis:** Practice evaluating time/space efficiency and output correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Maintain Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continue reviewing key concepts in:\n",
    "  - **Data (DAT)**\n",
    "  - **Computing Systems and Networks (CSN)**\n",
    "  - **Impact of Computing (IOC)**\n",
    "- Use practice questions and concept reviews to reinforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Study Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practice questions from **CodeHS** and the **College Board's AP CSP question bank**, with attention to Big Ideas and skill tags.\n",
    "- Review videos, notes, and online resources targeting areas of weakness.\n",
    "- Use **visual simulations** and **interactive tools** for algorithm analysis and Boolean logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "This practice exam was a helpful checkpoint. While I feel confident in most coding-related logic and structure, I now know exactly which areas to focus on in my review.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **targeted review** and **hands-on problem solving**, I’m confident I’ll be fully prepared on exam day.\n",
