    "\n",

    "- Focus areas:\n",
    "  - Iterative design process  \n",
    "  - Collaboration strategies  \n",
    "  - Ethical considerations  \n",
    "  - Responsible use of technology\n",
    "- Review examples and practice questions specifically related to CRD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Target Weak Areas within Algorithms and Programming (AAP)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Search:** Deepen understanding of the concept and practice coding it.\n",
    "- **Boolean Expressions:** Review truth tables, logic comparisons, and common traps.\n",
    "- **Data Abstraction:** Explore how data structures simplify code and improve reusability.\n",
    "- **Algorithm Analysis:** Practice evaluating time/space efficiency and output correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Maintain Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continue reviewing key concepts in:\n",
    "  - **Data (DAT)**\n",
    "  - **Computing Systems and Networks (CSN)**\n",
    "  - **Impact of Computing (IOC)**\n",
    "- Use practice questions and concept reviews to reinforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Study Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practice questions from **CodeHS** and the **College Board's AP CSP question bank**, with attention to Big Ideas and skill tags.\n",
    "- Review videos, notes, and online resources targeting areas of weakness.\n",
    "- Use **visual simulations** and **interactive tools** for algorithm analysis and Boolean logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "This practice exam was a helpful checkpoint. While I feel confident in most coding-related logic and structure, I now know exactly which areas to focus on in my review.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **targeted review** and **hands-on problem solving**, I’m confident I’ll be fully prepared on exam day.\n",
