    "## Individual Feature Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "My feature is called club creator. It is a page on the website where users can create new clubs by inputting the club name, club description, and choosing club topics from a preset checklist of topics. When the user submits the form, the data will be stored in the backend database schema and the club will be created. Multiple clubs with the same name cannot be created. This feature is essentially the backbone of our project because many of our other features utilize the club creator feature such as joining/leaving clubs, leadership roles, and matching users to clubs based on their similar interests. Ultimately, the feature should work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Users open up the submission form and input data for a new club they would like to create. \n",
    "2. After submission, the club data should be posted into backend schema and displayed on the frontend as a new club in the club container.\n",
    "3. For each club in the club box, they have their own card that displays the club information as well as the creator of the club and members and member count.\n",
    "4. There is a delete button on the club card that allows only the creator of the club to delete it (authentication, @tokenrequired)\n",
    "5. There is an update button on the club card that only allows the creator to update the club information\n",
    "6. The delete and update buttons on the club cards only display for the clubs that the user created, otherwise the club cards won't have delete or update."
