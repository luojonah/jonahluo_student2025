    "#### What did I learn from the quiz?\n",
    "<br>I learned a lot about online safety, decrypting and encrypting messages <br>online. I also was able to learn and enhance my abilities to analyze and <br>debug coding logic that had problems or missing pieces of code which <br>made me feel a lot more prepared for those type of questions on the AP <br>exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Which types of questions am I weaker on?\n",
    "<br> I found that I was weaker towards that questions that had multiple <br>answers for some reason. I would nail one answer but then get another <br>option wrong. I think to improve this, I just need to analyze the <br>options more carefully. I also noticed I got a few problems wrong due to <br>misreading or misunderstanding the problem at hand. To solve this, I <br>should read problems more carefully before I start answering."
