    "In Sprint 2, I had the opportunity to teach about conditionals and nested conditionals, while other students covered foundational topics in <br>Python and JavaScript, such as variables, arrays, and data file types. This section was particularly memorable due to the creative <br>approaches each group brought to their lessons. We used vibrant, themed lesson pages, making the material more visually engaging and fun to <br>explore. This added a unique element to each lesson and helped to sustain the class's interest, keeping us all involved and attentive.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>What really made this experience stand out was how interactive the lessons were. Each group incorporated quizzes that challenged us to apply <br>what weâ€™d learned, reinforcing our understanding in real-time. Additionally, the homework assignments (often referred to as \"homework <br>hacks\") presented coding problems that allowed us to deepen our knowledge outside the classroom. Working through these assignments helped me <br>enhance my coding skills and solidify my understanding of the material.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>Overall, Sprint 2 was not only a rewarding learning experience but also a significant boost to my programming abilities. Teaching others <br>about conditionals while exploring the creative lesson formats my peers developed truly made the process enjoyable. The combination of <br>engaging lesson designs, hands-on coding tasks, and interactive quizzes made learning both challenging and fun."
