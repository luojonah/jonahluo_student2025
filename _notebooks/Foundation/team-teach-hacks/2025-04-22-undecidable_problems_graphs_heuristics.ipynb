    "**1. Research and write a brief explanation of another undecidable problem not discussed in class**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Post Correspondence Problem is an undecidable decision problem in computer science. It involves two lists of strings, and the task is to find a sequence of indices such that the concatenation of strings from both lists, using that sequence, results in the same string. For example, using list A and list B, we seek indices where aᵢ₁aᵢ₂... = bᵢ₁bᵢ₂.... Despite its simplicity, there is no general algorithm that can determine whether a solution exists for every possible input, making it undecidable.\n",

    "The Nearest Neighbor algorithm is a simple heuristic for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem. It starts at a random city, then repeatedly visits the nearest unvisited city until all cities are visited, finally returning to the starting point. Here's a basic Python implementation:\n",

    "\n",
    "GPS navigation systems often use heuristics, like the A* algorithm, to find the fastest or shortest path through a road network. Computing the exact shortest path can be extremely time-consuming, especially in large cities with many intersections and traffic data. Heuristics help estimate the best route quickly by considering both distance and real-time conditions like congestion. An exact solution would be impractical in real-time applications where speed and responsiveness are critical.\n",
