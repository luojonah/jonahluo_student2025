    "## **Create Club Feature – AP Computer Science Principles CPT & FRQ Alignment**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Feature Overview**  \n",
    "My individual feature for our **Club Hub** website was the **Create Club** functionality, which serves as the **core component** of our program. Without this feature, dependent functionalities across the system would fail, demonstrating the importance of modular program design and **abstraction**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **User Interaction & Data Management**  \n",
    "- Users can **submit a form** to create new clubs, with club data stored in dynamically generated **club objects**.  \n",
    "- Club data is displayed in **club cards**, structured using **pagination** to enhance usability and **improve algorithmic efficiency** in data retrieval and display. Each page contains exactly **three club cards**, preventing excessive scrolling and improving **data accessibility**.  \n",
    "- Users can **update and delete** clubs, but **only for clubs they created**. This implements a form of **data encapsulation and access control**, preventing unauthorized modifications and ensuring **data integrity**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Integration with Other Features**  \n",
    "- **Interest-based club recommendations**: User input is matched with **club attributes** through **data filtering** to provide **personalized recommendations**.  \n",
    "- **Event creation integration**: Club leaders can generate events in the **Event feature**, which fetches club-related data such as **name, description, and creator** from the **clubs database**, demonstrating **data abstraction and interoperability**.  \n",
    "- **Leadership application system**: Leadership forms are dynamically **linked to existing clubs**, ensuring data validity by fetching verified club records from the **centralized database**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By following **principles of data abstraction, modularity, and security**, my **Create Club** feature ensures a seamless, user-friendly experience while maintaining data integrity and proper access control across the Club Hub platform.  \n"

    "- **5 Points Over 12 Weeks**: I think I deserve a 4.7/5 because I was able to accomplish a lot and I was very efficient over the last 12 weeks. I also helped out with my group and lead a lot of discussions and help sessions after school on discord calls with friends.\n",
    "- **Full Stack Project Demo**: Our full stack project demo went successfully at Night @ the Museum which was thanks to our group's rehersals and practice on discord calls prior to the showcase as well as a practice-live demo with Ms. Pataki during class.\n",
    "- **Project Feature Blog Write-Up**: My feature write-up features description of my feature, how it integrates with the rest of my website all the while including CPT and collegeboard FRQ vocabulary.\n",
    "- **MCQ**: I provided a detailed review of the test on how I did, as well as went over every question I got wrong and why I got it wrong. I also displayed the CPT topics that I was struggling with on the MCQ.\n",
    "- **10th Point**: I think I deserve a .9/1 on the 10th point because I met every bullet point except for DMing Mr. Mort 24 hours prior to the review.\n"
