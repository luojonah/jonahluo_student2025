    "My multiple choice score didn't increase too much but I think that partially has to do with the fact that I think I did really good on my first multiple choice exam. As seen in the score distribution below, I struggled most with **Computing Systems & Networks** problems, specifically internet safety questions as well as variable and binary questions. Overrall, I think I was able to improve a lot from my previous exam, especially with the help of actually understanding vocabulary terms.\n",

    "**A. Certifying the data with a Creative Commons license before sending it**  \n",
    "- **Reason:** Creative Commons licenses govern content usage, not security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correct Answer:  \n",
    "**C. Sending the data using public-key encryption**  \n",

    "**A. I and II only**  \n",

    "**C. II and III only**  \n",

    "**B and D**  \n",
    "- **Reason:**  \n",
    "  - The inner `count = 0` inside the loop resets `count` for every word in the list, preventing proper accumulation.\n",
    "  - **B:** The procedure fails to correctly count occurrences of `\"maple\"`.  \n",
    "  - **D:** Since `\"spruce\"` does not exist in the list, the function should return `0`, but due to the incorrect loop logic, it may not.\n",
    "\n",

    "Remove the incorrect inner reset of `count = 0` to allow proper accumulation.\n"
