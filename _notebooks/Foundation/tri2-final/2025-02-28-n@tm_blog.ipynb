However, there are still things that we could change and improve, such as organization, which could be done using containers. We also received comments suggesting more user interaction, which could be done by adding more animations and flashy pages that catch the user's attention. We also received suggestions to link ASB instructions to make it more realistic if it were actually used in our school to manage clubs.\n",

Instead, my interests lie heavily in STEM related activities and research. From previous and ongoing research experiences, I have observed that computer science is a really important tool in conducting scientific research, and so I hope to pursue to apply what I've learned so far in Computer Science Principles into scientific research and studies, maybe even pursuing this in college as well. I also know that this is definately a very important skill that could help with my application to internships related to STEM as well as even my career in the future.\n",
