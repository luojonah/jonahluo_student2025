## 🛠️ Development Process

1. **Planning**  
   Brainstormed creative ideas that would meet all CPT requirements while highlighting my coding strengths.

2. **Designing**  
   Built wireframes and pseudocode to structure the logic and design of my program.

3. **Implementation**  
   Wrote the actual code, ensuring inclusion of algorithms, procedures, and data abstraction.

4. **Testing**  
   Debugged and refined my code to ensure smooth performance and correct output.

5. **Documentation**  
   Created detailed written responses and recorded a concise video demonstration.

## 🧠 Helpful Resources

### 📚 Mr. Mortenson’s Guides

Mr. Mortenson’s resources played a crucial role in my preparation:

- Sample projects with strong implementations  
- Rubric breakdowns explaining AP grader expectations  
- Feedback sessions for early drafts  
- Step-by-step guidance to check off every CPT requirement

### 🤝 Trimester Two Prep Group

Huge thanks to my study group who:

- Organized peer review sessions  
- Shared successful past projects  
- Built a doc of common pitfalls to avoid  
- Ran mock grading sessions  

Their advice on algorithms and abstraction clarity greatly shaped my final submission.

## 🔑 Tips for Success

These were key to my success and will help you too:

- Start early, plan thoroughly  
- Keep your code neat and well-commented  
- Practice explaining your program out loud  
- Double check your rubric before submission  
- Get feedback from peers or teachers  
- Ensure your video shows everything clearly

## 🪞 Reflection

This project challenged and grew my abilities in planning, coding, and documenting. Breaking it into smaller tasks helped me stay on track and meet all criteria. I’m proud of my submission—and I want to take it further.

### 💡 What’s Next?

I plan to build a brand-new CPT project from scratch, exploring different algorithms, data structures, and coding techniques. Repeating the process will help me sharpen my skills and deepen my understanding.
