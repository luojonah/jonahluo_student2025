# AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) Study Guide  
## üìò Unit 1: Creative Development

Welcome to my Unit 1 study guide for AP CSP. This guide breaks down the key concepts of **Big Idea 1: Creative Development**, including program design, abstraction, implementation, and debugging.

---

## üß† 1.1 Program Design and Development

- **Program Purpose**  
  Understand the goals and intended use of a program.

- **Program Design**  
  Use algorithms, flowcharts, and pseudocode to outline your logic.

- **Incremental Development**  
  Build your program step-by-step, testing as you go.

- **Collaboration Tools**  
  Practice pair programming and use version control (e.g., Git).

- **Documentation**  
  Write clean, readable code with comments and docs.

---

## üß± 1.2 Program Abstraction

- **Procedural Abstraction**  
  Modularize code using functions and procedures.

- **Data Abstraction**  
  Use variables, lists, and APIs to manage complexity.

- **Levels of Abstraction**  
  From high-level programming down to binary and hardware.

- **Hiding Implementation Details**  
  Create clear interfaces‚Äîusers don‚Äôt need to see the inner workings.

- **Parameters and Return Values**  
  Make your functions flexible by passing and returning data.

---

## üß© 1.3 Program Design and Implementation

- **Problem-Solving Strategies**  
  Break large problems into manageable parts.

- **Algorithm Design**  
  Design step-by-step logical solutions to solve problems.

- **Programming Language Features**  
  Use variables, loops, conditionals, and functions effectively.

- **Libraries and APIs**  
  Leverage pre-built modules to enhance your programs.

- **Testing and Validation**  
  Always verify that your program works correctly under various conditions.

## üêû 1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors

- **Types of Errors**  
  Recognize syntax, logic, and runtime errors.

- **Debugging Techniques**  
  Use print statements, debuggers, and code tracing.

- **Testing Strategies**  
  Test with normal, edge, and boundary inputs.

- **Error Handling**  
  Use try/catch blocks and helpful error messages.

- **Code Review**  
  Collaborate with peers to catch and fix bugs.

*Keep reviewing and practicing these concepts‚Äîthey're the foundation of everything you'll do in AP CSP and beyond!*
