# AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) Study Guide  
## 🧮 Unit 2: Data

This guide explores **Big Idea 2: Data**, focusing on how digital data is represented, compressed, processed, and used to draw conclusions.

---

## 💾 2.1 Binary Data Representation

- **Binary Numbers**  
  Understand how decimal values are represented in binary form.

- **Bits and Bytes**  
  Learn the basic digital storage units and their significance.

- **Binary Conversions**  
  Convert between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal formats.

- **Fixed vs. Floating Point**  
  Understand how integers and real numbers are stored differently.

- **Limitations**  
  Recognize issues like numeric overflow and precision loss.

---

## 📦 2.2 Data Compression

- **Lossless Compression**  
  Compress data without losing any information (e.g., ZIP).

- **Lossy Compression**  
  Remove less-important data to reduce size (e.g., JPEG, MP3).

- **Common Formats**  
  Explore real-world formats that use compression.

- **Run-Length Encoding**  
  Understand simple repetition-based compression.

- **Huffman Coding**  
  Learn how compression can be based on frequency of use.

## 📊 2.3 Extracting Information from Data

- **Data Collection**  
  Techniques for gathering raw data from various sources.

- **Data Analysis**  
  Extract patterns and insights from collected data.

- **Visualization Tools**  
  Use charts, graphs, and visuals to communicate data effectively.

- **Metadata**  
  Data about data—helps in organizing and understanding context.

- **Drawing Conclusions**  
  Make logical inferences from analyzed data sets.

---

## 🧰 2.4 Using Programs with Data

- **Data Processing**  
  Transform raw data into usable forms.

- **Data Filtering**  
  Select relevant information based on criteria.

- **Searching Algorithms**  
  Efficiently locate specific values in data.

- **Sorting Algorithms**  
  Order data to make it easier to analyze or use.

- **Data Storage**  
  Explore how data is saved in databases and file systems.

---

## 🌐 2.5 Big Data

- **Characteristics**  
  Volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of massive data sets.

- **Benefits**  
  Discover insights, patterns, and trends through analysis.

- **Challenges**  
  Consider issues like data storage, processing power, and privacy.

- **Technologies**  
  Tools like Hadoop, MapReduce, and cloud platforms enable big data work.

- **Ethical Considerations**  
  Be aware of privacy, bias, and data security in large-scale data analysis.
