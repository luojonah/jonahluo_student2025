# AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) Study Guide  
## üåê Unit 4: Computer Systems and Networks

Explore **Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Networks**, focusing on how computers and networks work together to communicate, store, and process information.

---

## üåç 4.1 The Internet
- **Internet Architecture**: Routers, switches, servers  
- **Protocols**: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP  
- **IP Addressing**: IPv4, IPv6, DHCP  
- **Domain Name System (DNS)**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses  
- **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**: Provide access to the internet

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 4.2 Fault Tolerance
- **Redundancy**: Backup systems/components for reliability  
- **Error Detection**: Use of checksums and codes  
- **Error Correction**: Correcting transmission errors  
- **Failover Systems**: Automatic switch to backup systems  
- **Distributed Systems**: Spread risk across multiple computers

---

## üßÆ 4.3 Parallel and Distributed Computing
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple processors/cores working simultaneously  
- **Distributed Computing**: Sharing tasks across machines  
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing tasks efficiently  
- **MapReduce**: Breaking down and combining data processing  
- **Cloud Computing**: Using network-based resources

---

## üñ•Ô∏è 4.4 Computer Components
- **CPU**: Brain of the computer; executes instructions  
- **Memory (RAM)**: Short-term, fast-access storage  
- **Storage**: Long-term data holding (e.g., SSD, HDD)  
- **Input/Output Devices**: Interfaces like keyboard, monitor  
- **Motherboard**: The main circuit board connecting everything

---

## üß† 4.5 Operating Systems
- **Functions**: Manage resources and user interaction  
- **Process Management**: Runs multiple programs at once  
- **Memory Management**: Controls access to memory  
- **File Systems**: Organizes and retrieves files  
- **User Interfaces**: Command line and graphical environments

---

## üåê 4.6 Networks
- **Types**: LAN (local), WAN (wide), PAN (personal), MAN (metropolitan)  
- **Topologies**: Star, bus, mesh, ring‚Äîways devices are arranged  
- **Devices**: Routers, switches, access points  
- **Performance Metrics**: Bandwidth = speed, latency = delay  
- **Connection Types**: Wired (Ethernet) vs. Wireless (Wi-Fi)

---

## üîê 4.7 Network Security
- **Threats**: Malware, phishing scams, DDoS attacks  
- **Encryption**: Protects data in transit  
- **Authentication**: Ensures user identity  
- **Authorization**: Controls access rights  
- **Security Tools**: Firewalls, antivirus software
