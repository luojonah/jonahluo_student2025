# Reflection on My First Website in AP Computer Science Principles

In our first assignment for AP Computer Science Principles (period 3), we were tasked with creating a basic website using Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks. Going into the project, I was excited but a bit unsure of how the process would unfold. I had some experience with coding, but working with Markdown in a notebook environment was new to me.

## The Process:
Markdown turned out to be a really efficient way to structure content. I appreciated how simple it was to format text with headers, lists, and links, without needing to dive into complicated HTML syntax. It allowed me to focus on the content and structure of my website rather than worrying too much about design elements.

Using Jupyter Notebooks was also an interesting experience. At first, I thought of Jupyter as more of a tool for coding and data science, but integrating it with Markdown made it a surprisingly effective tool for building simple, interactive websites. I especially liked being able to preview my changes right in the notebook as I worked, which made the process feel more dynamic.

## Challenges:
One of the main challenges I faced was figuring out how to balance the content and code in Markdown. I also needed to get comfortable switching between text formatting and adding elements like code blocks or links to make the website functional and easy to navigate. Another hurdle was learning how to display HTML properly inside Jupyter Notebooks, but I overcame that by using `IPython.display` to embed HTML content.

## What I Learned:
This project reinforced the importance of planning out a website’s structure before diving in. I learned how versatile Markdown can be, especially when combined with tools like Jupyter. It was rewarding to see how quickly I could create a functioning website using just a few lines of Markdown. 

I also gained a new appreciation for Jupyter Notebooks, as they can be used not just for coding, but for creating content-rich presentations or even basic websites. I now feel more confident in my ability to use Markdown and Jupyter together to build more complex projects in the future.

## Looking Forward:
I'm excited to see how we’ll build on this foundation in future assignments. This was a great introduction to the power of simple web development, and I can’t wait to explore more advanced techniques and tools as the course progresses.
